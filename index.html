<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Welcome! I am a second-year undergraduate student at
    <a href="https://case.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a>, studying
    mathematics and computer science. I expect to graduate in Spring '26, and
    then I hope pursue a graduate degree in one of the above fields. (I haven't
    decided which yet because they're both utterly fascinating.)

    Hopefully you find this page informative. If you have any questions,
    comments, just want to chat, or anything else, feel free to reach out to me
    via my email, which is ash[number]@case.edu, with [number] having the prime
    factorization of 2*2*2*2*2*5.
</p>

<h2>Where I've Been Before</h2>

    As for specifics on my academics beyond what I cover in the introduction,
    you can find them split across math and CS below.

<h2>What I'm Up To Now</h2>

<p>
The summer of 2024, I will be involved with quantum computing research, and a
smattering of other activities, of which here is a rough list. Feel free to
reach out about anything that interests you:
<ul>
    <li>Working through the second draft of my novel.</li>
    <li>Creating a LISP interpreter in C.</li>
    <li>Writing a C preprocessor.</li>
    <li>Doing research into hyperoperations on finite groups.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
With the coming of the Fall 2024 semester, I will be involved in mainly graduate
coursework in math and CS, as well as continuing my research.

<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>
While not an area I actively study, I have always enjoyed music (listening,
performing, and composing) as a hobby.
</p>
<p>
I have sung for over a decade now, tenor / baritone, and have recently begun to
enjoy barbershop music. Here is me after a performance with Briefcase, a
barbershop octet I sing with at Case:

<p>
I also enjoy composing, mainly for piano and voice. My piano compositions are
mainly either <a href="documents/Clouds.pdf">serene melodies</a> or random
catchy beats I make up while messing around on a keyboard, while my vocal
compositions tend to be very smooth, flowing, classical-esque works.
</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>
One of my other longest-lasting hobbies is writing. Two friends and I wrote a
book back in 2017, which was so badly written (as we were 13) that I will not
link a copy of it here for shame. I am currently editing a book, <i>We Are Not
Those Who Came Before Us</i>, about the experiences of teenagers who went
through the COVID pandemic.

<h2>Miscellaneous Pictures</h2>

<p>
While I spend most of my time living in Ohio now for school, California and its
landscapes will always hold a special place in my heart. I've grown to love the
scorching summer days and the cool nights, the winter rains and the spring
bloom. Here are some of my favorite pictures from the lands around where I grew
up and formed memories.
