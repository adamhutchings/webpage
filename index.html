<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Welcome! I am a second-year undergraduate student at
    <a href="https://case.edu">Case Western Reserve University</a>, studying
    mathematics and computer science. I expect to graduate in Spring '26, and
    then I hope pursue a graduate degree in one of the above fields--I can't
    decide which because I love them both so much!
</p>

<h2>Where I've Been Before</h2>
<p>
    If you think you know me from somewhere, it may be from:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>2010-2016: Willett Elementary School, Davis, California</li>
    <li>2016-2017: John F. Kennedy School, Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>2017-2019: Holmes Junior High School, Davis, California</li>
    <li>Summers 2017-2019: GLS Schm√∂ckwitz, Berlin, Germany</li>
    <li>Summers 2018-2019: Center for Talented Youth (camper), JHU and LMU sites</li>
    <li>2019-2022: Davis Senior High School, Davis, California</li>
    <li>2022-current: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH</li>
    <li>Summer 2023: Center for Talented Youth (staff member), BRI site</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<p>
    With both my <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching">father</a> and my
    <a href="https://education.ucdavis.edu/faculty-profile/tom-sallee">
    grandfather</a> having been math professors, I have been exposed to math my
    whole life. It has always been a top interest of mine and I am looking
    forward to learning as much as I can.
</p>
<p>
    During the summer of 2022 I did <a href="file:documents/T3.pdf"> my first
    mathematical investigation</a> on the Thue-Morse sequence, with my longtime
    friend and collaborator <a href="https://jr0.org">Jake Roggenbuck</a>. At
    some point we plan to do more research into this area.
</p>
<p>
    My main areas of interest are in differential equations, (abstract) algebra,
    and the parts of math that concern areas in computer science, like
    computational methods, integral transforms, and so forth. Of course I am
    nowhere near an expert -- there's a lot to learn. But I'm doing my best to
    get there!
</p>

<p>My coursework in math thus far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2023-24: abstract algebra, two semesters of undergraduate real
        analysis, graph theory, knot theory
        <ul>
            <li>
                Courses audited: graduate algebra, category theory
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        2022-23: differential equations, theoretical linear algebra
    </li>
    <li>
        Earlier: calculus (single- and multi-variable), linear algebra
    </li>
</ul>
<p>My work/research experience in math thus far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Summer 2023: teaching assistant at
        <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/who-we-are">CTY</a> in Bristol, RI for
        the "Paradoxes and Infinities" course, touching on many areas of
        math including modern algebra, logic, set theory, and geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summer 2022: instructor at <a href="https://www.mathnasium.com">
        Mathnasium</a>, where I tutored in math from basic arithmetic up to
        pre-calculus.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summer 2018 onwards: independent math tutor.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>

<p>
I started to get seriously involved with programming in late 2019, when I was a
tenth-grader at Davis Senior High. Since then, I have developed projects in four
main languages, in teams and alone, for a variety of applications.

Languages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Highly proficient in C
    </li>
    <li>
        Proficient in Python
    </li>
    <li>
        Proficient in Java
    </li>
    <li>
        Intermediate in C++
    </li>
    <li>
        Beginner in JavaScript
    </li>
    <li>
        Enough HTML/CSS to make this page
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Besides C, which I have used a large amount, each of C++/Java/Python I have used 
roughly equally. The varying proficiency levels in them is mainly due the 
time since last major use, and for C++ particularly, knowledge (or lack thereof)
of "idiomatic", "modern" styles.
</p>

<p>
While the
full extent of my projects and tools is available on
<a href="https://github.com/adamhutchings"> my GitHub page</a> (both my own
repositories and the organizations I am part of), here is a rundown of some of
the highlights:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/adamhutchings/cml">cml</a> (Summer 2023):
        from-scratch machine-learning framework in C.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/y-flat">Y-flat</a> (2022): incomplete
        compiler (with relating tooling done by Jake Roggenbuck among others)
        for my custom programming language Y-flat. Several thousand lines of C
        code, with a lexer, parser, analyzer, etc. all custom-made.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/adamhutchings/Minecraft3D">Minecraft clone
        </a> (2021): a sandbox world generator, modeled and textured after
        Minecraft, that I made using OpenGL and C++.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/qmegame">QME</a> (2021): an (incomplete) 4X
        strategy game whose development I led/co-led, collaboratively with
        several programmers, artists, and designers. This was a wonderful
        experience in collaborative development and teamwork.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>And here is my computer-science-related coursework:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2023-24: artificial intelligence, discrete math, operating systems,
        algorithms, quantum computing, programming language concepts
    </li>
    <li>
        2022-23: data structures, logic design
    </li>
    <li>
        Earlier: computer science principles, introduction to Java
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>
While not an area I actively study, I have always enjoyed music (listening,
performing, and composing) as a hobby.
</p>
<p>
I have sung for over a decade now, tenor / baritone, and have recently begun to
enjoy barbershop music. Here is me after a performance with Luggage, a
barbershop octet I sing with at Case:
</p>

<p>
I also enjoy composing, mainly for piano and voice. My piano compositions are
mainly either <a href="file:documents/Clouds.pdf">serene melodies</a> or random
catchy beats I make up while messing around on a keyboard, while my vocal
compositions tend to be very smooth, flowing, classical-esque works.
</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>
One of my other longest-lasting hobbies is writing. Two friends and I wrote a
book back in 2017, which was so badly written (as we were 13) that I will not
link a copy of it here for shame. I am currently editing a book, <i>We Are Not
Those Who Came Before Us</i>, about the experiences of teenagers who went
through the COVID pandemic.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Pictures</h2>

<p>
While I spend most of my time living in Ohio now for school, California and its
landscapes will always hold a special place in my heart. I've grown to love the
scorching summer days and the cool nights, the winter rains and the spring
bloom. Here are some of my favorite pictures from the lands around where I grew
up and formed memories.
