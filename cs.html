<p>
Starting in 2024, I have been active in research with quantum computing, in the
areas of variational quantum algorithms and approaches to simultaneous solving
processes.

The idea is that one can observe the solution process on one problem instance to
get some idea of how to approach another problem instance, so I (and the others
in the Kent-Case Quantum Group) try to do just that.

My very first paper, which you can read
<a href="documents/VQE_Submission_April_2024.pdf">here</a>, was accepted and
presented at at <a href="https://qcccadmin.github.io/qccc/">QCCC-24</a> in June
2024. This was joint work with Eric Yarnot, with help and contributions from
several others whose names are in the PDF.

I started to get seriously involved with programming in late 2019, when I was a
tenth-grader at Davis Senior High. Since then, I have developed projects in four
main languages, in teams and alone, for a variety of applications.

Languages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Highly proficient in C
    </li>
    <li>
        Proficient in Python
    </li>
    <li>
        Proficient in Java
    </li>
    <li>
        Intermediate in C++
    </li>
    <li>
        Beginner in Scheme and JavaScript
    </li>
    <li>
        Enough HTML/CSS to make this page
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Besides C, which I have used a large amount, each of C++/Java/Python I have used 
roughly equally. The varying proficiency levels in them is mainly due the 
time since last major use, and for C++ particularly, knowledge (or lack thereof)
of "idiomatic", "modern" styles.
</p>

While the
full extent of my projects and tools is available on
<a href="https://github.com/adamhutchings"> my GitHub page</a> (both my own
repositories and the organizations I am part of), here is a rundown of some of
the highlights:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/adamhutchings/cml">cml</a> (Summer 2023):
        from-scratch machine-learning framework in C.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/y-flat">Y-flat</a> (2022): incomplete
        compiler (with relating tooling done by Jake Roggenbuck among others)
        for my custom programming language Y-flat. Several thousand lines of C
        code, with a lexer, parser, analyzer, etc. all custom-made.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/adamhutchings/Minecraft3D">Minecraft clone
        </a> (2021): a sandbox world generator, modeled and textured after
        Minecraft, that I made using OpenGL and C++.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/qmegame">QME</a> (2021): an (incomplete) 4X
        strategy game whose development I led/co-led, collaboratively with
        several programmers, artists, and designers. This was a wonderful
        experience in collaborative development and teamwork.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>And here is my computer-science-related coursework:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2023-24: artificial intelligence, discrete math, operating systems,
        algorithms, quantum computing, programming language concepts
    </li>
    <li>
        2022-23: data structures, logic design
    </li>
    <li>
        Earlier: computer science principles, introduction to Java
    </li>
</ul>
