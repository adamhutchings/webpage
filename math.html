<h2>Mathematics</h2>

<h3><a href="index.html">Back to Home</a></h3>

<p>
    With both my <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching">father</a> and my
    <a href="https://education.ucdavis.edu/faculty-profile/tom-sallee">
    grandfather</a> having been math professors, I have been exposed to math my
    whole life. It has always been a top interest of mine and I am looking
    forward to learning as much as I can.
</p>
<p>
    During the summer of 2022 I did <a href="documents/T3.pdf"> my first
    mathematical investigation</a> on the Thue-Morse sequence, with my longtime
    friend and collaborator <a href="https://jr0.org">Jake Roggenbuck</a>. At
    some point we plan to do more research into this area.
</p>
<p>
    My main areas of interest are in differential equations, (abstract) algebra,
    and the parts of math that concern areas in computer science, like
    computational methods, integral transforms, and so forth. Of course I am
    nowhere near an expert -- there's a lot to learn. But I'm doing my best to
    get there!
</p>

<p>
    This past year (2023) I somehow earned a 22 on the Putnam exam. Hopefully
    this next year I'll do even better.
</p>

<p>My coursework in math thus far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        2023-24: abstract algebra, two semesters of undergraduate real
        analysis, graph theory, knot theory
        <ul>
            <li>
                Courses audited: graduate algebra
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        2022-23: differential equations, theoretical linear algebra
    </li>
    <li>
        Earlier: calculus (single- and multi-variable), linear algebra
    </li>
</ul>
<p>My work/research experience in math thus far:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Summer 2023: teaching assistant at
        <a href="https://cty.jhu.edu/who-we-are">CTY</a> in Bristol, RI for
        the "Paradoxes and Infinities" course, touching on many areas of
        math including modern algebra, logic, set theory, and geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summer 2022: instructor at <a href="https://www.mathnasium.com">
        Mathnasium</a>, where I tutored in math from basic arithmetic up to
        pre-calculus.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summer 2018 onwards: independent math tutor.
    </li>
</ul>
